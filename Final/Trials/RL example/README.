This is an initial trial version, corresponding to the first attempt described in the reinforcement learning in the report. The purpose of this folder is to give examples of corresponding reports, and to provide possible ideas for building neural networks!

PS:
1. There are still many bugs in this file, although the Train.py file can already be trained
2. There may still be many mathematical errors in this document, which will be checked one by one in the future
3. This document is only used to give examples of reports, not for evaluation
