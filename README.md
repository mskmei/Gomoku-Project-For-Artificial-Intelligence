# Gomoku project

This is the final project of DATA130008.01 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. The content of Project can be roughly devided into 4 parts:

+ Midterm 1: Complete gomoku agent based on Minimax search and apply Alpha-Beta pruning. (elo will be around 1100)
+ Midterm 2: Complete gomoku agent based on Monte Carlo Tree Search with UCT. (elo will be around 1000)
+ Final|Part 1: Implement Reinforcement leanrning. In this part we will carry out ADP and consider value approximation by applying neural network.(elo will be low)
+ Final|Part 2: Improve one of above algorithms and try to get higher elo. In this part we will try Minimax with Threat Space search. The target score of agent is 1500 but minimax with TSS can only reach 1300. Maybe more attention should be paid to compute kill strategy.

Besides, we also carry out some intereting experiments and some heuristic algorithms in the project. Some of them may be typical failure but can offer splendid example in the report. For instance, in the final part, we try Heuristic application in MCTS and compare it with MCTS based UCT.
